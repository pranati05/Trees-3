# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No

# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
#First Approach Iterative where we check if root is none then we found no tree so return true
#If there is a tree and left and right nodes then we add them to stack. Then we pop the nodes and check its value if it matches that means it is symmetric
#We will do the same process until we reach leaf where both left and right are none. If one is none return false
#The tree should be a mirror of left and right side so we comapre left.left with right.right and left.right with right.left
#Second Approach recursive where we have a helper function which returns True if both values are same
